# MRESN with CNN Feature Extraction Layer for Regression Problem

This repository contains an implementation of the Multi-Reservoir Echo State Network (MRESN) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction layer for solving a regression problem. The architecture is based on the paper "Multi-Reservoir Echo State Network for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Remaining Useful Life Prediction" by Rania Mezzi, Marie-Cécile Péra, Simon Morando, Daniel Hissel, Nadia Steiner, et al.
